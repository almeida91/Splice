Splice is a library that helps with creation and execution of genetic algorithms.

To build from source open the project in Eclipse or Intellij and use the src/ folder to export as a jar package.

Look for samples/ folder to see how to build simple genetic algorithms.
Samples included:
	samples/knapsack/
		the knapsack problem resolution
	samples/nqueens/
		it solves the N-Queens problem
	samples/tsp/
		solves the traveling salesman problem
	samples/zeros/
		evolves a list of integers until its values are all zeros
	samples/rosenbrock
		minimization of bidimensional rosenbrock function
